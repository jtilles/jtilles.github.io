    I did not let school get in the way of my education; only half of what I learned at UCF came from the classroom.  Having the opportunity to co-op with engineering companies during my tenure gave me valuable experience that springboarded me into my career.

    My years spent in Orlando at University of Central Florida were very formative for my engineering career and my life.  Between school, internships, extracurriculars and personal life I learned how to time and priority management.

    I spent a lot of my time with my Engineering Fraternity *Theta Tau* in which I took leadership roles including **Vice President**.
