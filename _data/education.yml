    My years spent in Orlando at University of Central Florida were very formative for my engineering career and my life.  Between school, internships, extracurriculars and personal life I learned how to time and priority management.

    I spent a lot of my time with my Engineering Fraternity *Theta Tau* in which I took leadership roles including **Vice President**.
