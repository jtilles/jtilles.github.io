    ## **[Navigation Dopplar Lidar (NDL)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvcXZa8-Hpk)** - Electronics Engineer
    *NDL is a novel system that is designed and slated to be used in future moon landers including the [Artemis](https://www.nasa.gov/specials/artemis/) mission (returning America to the Moon).  It uses triple pulsed LIDAR to provide altitude and velocity vectors for the landing system*
    ##### Tasks
    * Mature electronics from an engineering demonstration to NASA Class A to be used on Human Space Flight.
    * Develop Spread System Test Board and Test Procedures
    * Perform environmental testing on electronics assemblies

    {:.projectTitle}
    ## **[SAGE IV](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/langley/prototype-ozone-monitoring-instrument-undergoes-sun-look-testing)** - Electronics Design Engineer
    *Stratospheric Air and Gas Experiment (SAGE) IV is a project proposal to shrink the previous SAGE instruments ([SAGE III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAGE_III_on_ISS)) to fit on a cubesat to lower costs, increase launch opportunities, and ensure continuity of measurement data.  SAGE passively measures atmospheric conditions using the sun and a spectrometer.
    ##### Tasks
    * Mature electronics from engineering breadboard development to a full flight ready, rad-hard design
    * Work closely with thermal and mechanical engineers to insure electronics design meets SWAP (Size, Weight and Power) requirements of the instrument.
    * Develop flight level electronics documentation
    
    {:.projectTitle}
    ## **[Athena](https://ceres.larc.nasa.gov/documents/STM/2019-10/5-WED_1205pm_Priestley.pdf)** - Electronics Lead/ Designer
    *[Athena](https://www.wired.com/story/now-entering-orbit-tiny-lego-like-modular-satellites/) was a fast paced, high risk, technology demonstration that exercised Langley's ability to work with commercial partners (NovaWurks) to develop a small earth science sattelite payload. Athena is slated to be launched in 2022*
    ##### Tasks
    * Architect the electronics systems
    * Design, build, test and deliver the avionics circuit board.
    * Lead a small, agile team of engineers to design, build, test and deliver Athena electronics system along with associated Ground Support Equipment (GSE)
    * Work hand in hand with the software team to develop and test the embedded software
    * Calibration of sensors
    * Designed Automated Test, utilizing lab equipment and [Plotly's Dash Flask Web Framework](https://dash.plotly.com/)
    
    {:.projectTitle}
    ## **[MEDLI2](https://gameon.nasa.gov/projects/mars-entry-descent-and-landing-instrumentation-2-medli2/)** - Electronics Engineer
    *Mars Entry, Descent, and Landing Instrumentation 2 (MEDLI2) is a sensor suite designed to collect science data about the martian atmosphere during atmospheric entry on the Mars 2020 Perseverance Mission.  MEDLI2, integrated into the Perseverance lander's heat shield, will help man-kind learn more about the red planet. Mars 2020 was launched on July 30th, 2020 from Cape Caneveral via a ULA Atlas V.*
    ##### Tasks
    * Supported the electronics and sensors through the various environmental testings including: Burn-In, EMI/EMC, Thermal-Vaccum, and Vibration.
    * Performed Failure Analysis
    * Developed sensor simulator software (python) used to calibrate the myraid sensors

    {:.projectTitle}
    ## **[TALISMAN](https://technology.nasa.gov/patent/LAR-TOPS-220)** - Electronics Design Engineer
    *Tension Actuated in Space MANipulator (TALISMAN) was a technology demonstration project of a prototype, lightweight, long reach, robotic arm*
    ##### Tasks
    * Worked in a dynamic team to bring COTs electronics from previous iterations up to *path-to-flight* level electronics
    * Designed motor controller board to drive 4x Brushless DC motors (BLDC) using Rad-Hard Electronics *(Microsemi [RTG4](https://www.microsemi.com/product-directory/rad-tolerant-fpgas/3576-rtg4) & [LX7720](https://www.microsemi.com/product-directory/space-system-managers/3708-position-motor-controller-ic))* with resolver feedback
    * Tested and integrated electronics on TALISMAN Arm
    * Designed associated ground support equipment (GSE)
