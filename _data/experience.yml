    ## **[Navigation Dopplar Lidar (NDL)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvcXZa8-Hpk)** - Electronics Engineer
    
    *NDL is a novel system that is designed and slated to be used in future moon landers including the [Artemis] mission (returning America to the Moon).  It uses triple pulsed LIDAR to provide altitude and velocity vectors for the landing system*
    ##### Tasks
    * Mature electronics from an engineering demonstration to NASA Class A to be used on Human Space Flight.
    * Develop Spread System Test Board and Test Procedures
    * Perform environmental testing on electronics assemblies

    ## **[Athena](https://ceres.larc.nasa.gov/documents/STM/2019-10/5-WED_1205pm_Priestley.pdf)** - Electronics Lead/ Designer
    
    *[Athena](https://www.wired.com/story/now-entering-orbit-tiny-lego-like-modular-satellites/) was a fast paced, high risk, technology demonstration that exercised Langley's ability to work with commercial partners (NovaWurks) to develop a small earth science sattelite payload*
    ##### Tasks
    * Architect the electronics systems
    * Design, build, test and deliver the avionics circuit board.
    * Lead a small, agile team of engineers to design, build, test and deliver Athena electronics system along with associated Ground Support Equipment (GSE)
    * Work hand in hand with the software team to develop and test the embedded software
    * Calibration of sensors
    * Designed Automated Test, utilizing lab equipment and [Plotly's Dash Flask Web Framework](https://dash.plotly.com/)

    ## **[MEDLI2](https://gameon.nasa.gov/projects/mars-entry-descent-and-landing-instrumentation-2-medli2/)** - Electronics Engineer
    *Mars Entry, Descent, and Landing Instrumentation 2 (MEDLI2) is the follow on to MEDLI1, and was designed to help collect science data about the martian atmosphere during atmospheric entry on the Mars 2020 Mission.  MEDLI2 is a sensor suite integrated into the Mars 2020 perseverance lander's heat shield that launched on July 30th, 2020 from Cape Caneveral via a ULA Atlas V.*
    ##### Tasks
    * Supported the electronics and sensors through the various environmental testings including: Burn-In, EMI/EMC, Thermal-Vaccum, and Vibration.
    * Performed Failure Analysis
    * Developed sensor simulator software (python) used to calibrate the myraid sensors

    {:.projectTitle}
    ## **[TALISMAN](https://technology.nasa.gov/patent/LAR-TOPS-220)** - Electronics Design Engineer
    *Tension Actuated in Space MANipulator (TALISMAN) was a technology demonstration project of a prototype, lightweight, long reach, robotic arm*
    ##### Tasks
    * Worked in a dynamic team to bring COTs electronics from previous iterations up to *path-to-flight* level electronics
    * Designed motor controller board to drive 4x Brushless DC motors (BLDC) using Rad-Hard Electronics (Microsemi [RTG4](https://www.microsemi.com/product-directory/rad-tolerant-fpgas/3576-rtg4) & [LX7720](https://www.microsemi.com/product-directory/space-system-managers/3708-position-motor-controller-ic)) with resolver feedback
    * Tested and integrated electronics on 5m+ TALISMAN Arm
    * Designed associated ground support equipment (GSE)
