  Hi, my name is Josh and I am always looking for ways to improve, rather than accept life as it is.  Professionally, I'm an electrical engineer. I excel at bringing electronics designs through their full design cycle, from concept to fabrication and even to the dreaded documentation associated with it.  In addition to hands-on electronics work, I am also competent in 3D Mechanical Design utilizing SolidWorks (I am a Certified Solidworks Professional ([CSWP](https://www.solidworks.com/certifications/mechanical-design-cswp-mechanical-design))) which I apply to 3D printing.  I also know enough Python to be dangerous.

  I am most skilled in: <mark>Altium Designer Guru</mark>, <mark>PCB Design</mark>, <mark>Hands-On</mark>, <mark>Baking Chocolate Chip Cookies</mark>

  Alongside my interests in electrical engineering some of my other interests and hobbies are:
   - **Home Automation:** I use the [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io) project to *'Awaken my Home'*.  A hobby that has a *'wow'* factor to house guests (fireplace turning on via voice, announcements when dishwaser is clean, etc.), while usually not driving my wife *too* much crazy.  I focuse on local control of my connected devices, trying to minimize my reliance on the **cloud**
   - **Self Hosting:** The cloud is just someone else's computer... since I like to minimize my monthly subscriptions, I try to run as many ÂµServices as I can on my own hardware.  Has forced me to learn networking, docker, software configuration, and have a better understanding of Unix-based systems
   - **Wood Working:** Some times I can no longer stare at a computer screen, which is when I go out to my 'Workshop' (garage), and get my hands dirty (dusty).
   - **3D Printing:** Besides the occasional novel sculpture for the neighborhood kids, I focus mostly on practical prints.  I have souped up my [Prusa MK3S](https://shop.prusa3d.com/en/3d-printers/180-original-prusa-i3-mk3s-kit.html?gclid=CjwKCAjwps75BRAcEiwAEiACMSVOtc8_9xH6ZkwL3bo-5C-x4tDjTKyf4_KwSCYYftFeNXq7Vq9lkBoCdqkQAvD_BwE) with [Octoprint](https://octoprint.org/), allowing me to do remote control, remote monitoring, and cool timelapses.
