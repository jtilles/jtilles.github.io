  Hi, my name is Josh and I am always looking for ways to improve, rather than accept life as it is.  Professionally, I'm an electrical engineer. I excel at bringing electronics designs through their full design cycle, from concept to fabrication, documentation, testing and integration.  I exceed in a fast-paced, hands-on environment. In addition to hands-on electronics work, I am also fluent in 3D Mechanical Design and know enough Python to be dangerous.

  I am most skilled in: <mark>Altium Designer Guru</mark>, <mark>PCB Design</mark>, <mark>Hands-On</mark>, <mark>Python</mark> <mark>Baking Chocolate Chip Cookies</mark>

  I am always interested in learning and improving myself.  Through my hobbies, I am constantly adding to my "engineering tool belt".
   - **Home Automation:** I subscribe to the philosophy that if you frequently do the same thing, it should be automated.  I utilize the open source project [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io) to help me automate routine tasks.  This includes turning on lights at sunset so we never come home to a dark house, to automatically locking the door at night, adjusting the thermostat based on house occupancy, or alerting house members if doors are left open.  I focus on local control of my connected devices, trying to minimize my reliance on the **cloud** and turn the Internet-of-Things into *my* **Intra**net-of-Things.  Through the course of creating my smart-home, I have been forced to learn concepts like <mark>MQTT</mark>, <mark>reverse proxies</mark>, <mark>docker containers</mark>, <mark>network management</mark>. 
   - **Self Hosting:** In keeping in with mindset of local control, and avoid subscription fees, I try as much as possible to use services that I host on my local server rather than rely on external cloud providers.  I host services such as storage, wikis, websites, git repositories, continuous integration/ continuous deployment (CI/CD), network speed tests, backups, media management, network configuration, and databases.  These exercises have forced me to learn networking, docker, software configuration and generally have a better understanding of Unix-based systems.
   - **Wood Working:**  I love working with my hands, and seeing my designs become physical objects that improve life around the house.  Many of my ideas are figured out virtually in CAD before I bring them to life in my shop.
   - **3D Printing:** I focus mostly on practical prints that I design using mechanical CAD tools.  I have modified my [Prusa MK3S](https://shop.prusa3d.com/en/3d-printers/180-original-prusa-i3-mk3s-kit.html?gclid=CjwKCAjwps75BRAcEiwAEiACMSVOtc8_9xH6ZkwL3bo-5C-x4tDjTKyf4_KwSCYYftFeNXq7Vq9lkBoCdqkQAvD_BwE) with [Octoprint](https://octoprint.org/), allowing me to do remote control, remote monitoring, and cool time-lapses.
