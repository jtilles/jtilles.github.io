  Hi, my name's Josh and I'm an electrical engineer.  I accel at bringing electronics designs through their full design cycle, from concept to fabrication and the dreaded documentation associated with it.  In addition to hands-on electronics work, I am also competent in 3D Mechanical Design utilizing SolidWorks (I am a [CSWP](https://www.solidworks.com/certifications/mechanical-design-cswp-mechanical-design))

  I am most skilled in: <mark>AWS</mark> and <mark>Eating Pizza</mark>
