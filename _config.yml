  Hi, my name is Josh and I am always looking for ways to improve, rather than accept life as it is.  Professionally, I'm an electrical engineer. I excel at bringing electronics designs through their full design cycle, from concept to fabrication and even to the dreaded documentation associated with it.  In addition to hands-on electronics work, I am also competent in 3D Mechanical Design utilizing SolidWorks (I am a Certified Solidworks Professional ([CSWP](https://www.solidworks.com/certifications/mechanical-design-cswp-mechanical-design))) which I apply to 3D printing.  I also know enough Python to be dangerous.

  I am most skilled in: <mark>Altium Designer Guru</mark>, <mark>PCB Design</mark>, <mark>Hands-On</mark>, <mark>Baking Chocolate Chip Cookies</mark>

  I am always interested in learning and improving myself.  Through my hobbies, I am constantly adding to my "engineering tool belt".
   - **Home Automation:** I subscribe to the philosophy that if you frequently do the same thing, it should be automated.  I use the open source project [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io) help me automate routine tasks.  This includes turning on lights at sunset so we never come home to a dark house, to automatically locking the door at night, adjusting the thermostat based on house occupancy, or alerting house members if doors are left open.  I focus on local control of my connected devices, trying to minimize my reliance on the **cloud** and turn the Internet of Things into my Intranet of Things.
   - **Self Hosting:** In keeping in with mind set of local control, I try as much as possible to use services that I host on my local server rather than rely on external cloud providers.  I host services such as storage, wikis, websites, git repositories, continuous integration/ continuous deployment (CI/CD), speed tests, backups, media management, network configuration, and databases.  These exercises have forced me to learn networking, docker, software configuration and have a better understanding of Unix-based systems.
   - **Wood Working:**  I love working with my hands, and seeing my designs become physical objects that improve life around the house.  Many of my ideas are figured out virtually in SolidWorks before I bring them to life in my shop.
   - **3D Printing:** Besides the occasional novel sculpture for the neighborhood kids, I focus mostly on practical prints.  I have modified my [Prusa MK3S](https://shop.prusa3d.com/en/3d-printers/180-original-prusa-i3-mk3s-kit.html?gclid=CjwKCAjwps75BRAcEiwAEiACMSVOtc8_9xH6ZkwL3bo-5C-x4tDjTKyf4_KwSCYYftFeNXq7Vq9lkBoCdqkQAvD_BwE) with [Octoprint](https://octoprint.org/), allowing me to do remote control, remote monitoring, and cool time-lapses.
