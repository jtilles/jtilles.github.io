  Hi, my name's Josh and I do not like to accept life as it is, rather I see how I can improve it.  Professionally, I'm an electrical engineer; I accel at bringing electronics designs through their full design cycle, from concept to fabrication and the dreaded documentation associated with it.  In addition to hands-on electronics work, I am also competent in 3D Mechanical Design utilizing SolidWorks (I am a [CSWP](https://www.solidworks.com/certifications/mechanical-design-cswp-mechanical-design)) which I parlay into 3D printing.  I also know enough Python to be dangerous.

  I am most skilled in: <mark>PCB Design</mark>, <mark>Hands-On work</mark>, <mark>Baking Chocolate Chip Cookies</mark>
